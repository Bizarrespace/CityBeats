INFO: 
*******
This script MAY help you. You *should* have run "npx react-native doctor"
and fixed the issues first. This may help you with issues there if you can't figure out why doctor is failing.
      
BUT DO NOT try to run-android without BOTH "doctor" and this script reporting success.
      
Note that "WARN:" does not mean "Error", it means "be sure this is correct."

All output from this script will be logged to reactnative-fixup.txt
